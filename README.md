# Data Science Portfolio

Repository holding a portfolio of data science projects that I completed for academic, self-study, and recreational purposes.


# Data Science Project
* ## Predicting Bangalore Housing Prices:
 A model to predict the value of a given house in the bangalore real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

* ## Customer Churn Prediction:

 This project is similar to one I did at my firm (HTC Global Services), But here, I used a dataset from kaggle and performed different data pre-processing methods such as feature engineering, outlier detection, and so on. After experimenting with different machine learning models, I came up with a solid accuracy model that also produces a decent categorization report.
 
 
I'm about to upload a few more projects to this repository where I'm now working.
