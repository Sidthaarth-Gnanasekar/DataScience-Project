# Machine learning and Deep learning projects Portfolio

Repository holding a portfolio of Machine learning and Deep learning projects that I completed for academic, self-study, and recreational purposes.


# Machine learning and Deep learning projects Project
* ## Predicting Bangalore Housing Prices:
     * A model to predict the value of a given house in the bangalore real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

* ## Customer Churn Prediction:

     * This project is similar to one I did at my firm (HTC Global Services), But here, I used a dataset from kaggle and performed different data pre-processing methods such as feature engineering, outlier detection, and so on. After experimenting with different machine learning models, I came up with a solid accuracy model that also produces a decent categorization report.
 
 * ## Potato Disease Classification (CNN):

        * A plant disease image dataset is taken from the kaggle website and used tensorflow to load and pre-process the data. Tensorflow inbuilt functions like prefetch and cache are used to train the model agile, with the available CPU and GPU. Futhermore, built a CNN convolutional neural network to predict the disease of the potato. This project could be so useful to the farmer if implemented on front end and working on reactJS do so..
 
 
I'm about to upload a few more projects to this repository where I'm now working.
